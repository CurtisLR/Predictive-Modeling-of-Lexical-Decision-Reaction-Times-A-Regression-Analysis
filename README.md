This project looks at the variables influencing human word recognition speeds. It uses the English Lexicon Project dataset. The primary goal is to predict lexical decision reaction times based on psycholinguistic features such as word frequency, familiarity, and morphological structure. The analysis begins with data preprocessing to isolate younger participants and encode categorical predictors like word category and initial phoneme voicing.

Initial exploratory analysis utilizes LOWESS smoothing to demonstrate that the relationship between written frequency and reaction time is non-linear. The script compares various polynomial regression degrees to find an optimal fit that accounts for reaction times leveling off as words become more common. Model selection is performed using the Bayesian Information Criterion to prevent overfitting while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Lastly, LASSO regression is used to to perform automated feature selection across multiple standardized predictors. Written frequency and subjective familiarity are identified as the most significant drivers of recognition speed. The resulting model provides a mathematical representation of the cognitive processing involved in visual word recognition.
